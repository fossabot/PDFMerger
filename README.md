PDFMerger
=========

PHP Code to merge different PDFs using several libraries in order to maintain annotations (links & co)

* Originally uses FPDI 1.3.1 from Setasign.
* In this modified version uses FPDI v1.4.4 + FPDF_TPL v1.2.3 in order to use the annotations (render also links).
* By using fpdi2tcpdf it is possible to use FPDF by extending TCPDF!

TODO
* Insert appropriate links
